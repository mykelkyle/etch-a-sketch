# etch-a-sketch

The Odin Project Foundations (Etch-A-Sketch)

In this project I implemented

- DOM manipulation
- Multiple event listeners
- CSS Grid/Flexbox
- hover states

Some challenges I faced

- How to iterate grid columns/rows/cells with JS
- How to implement "drawing" functionality (done by linking mousedown/mouseover/mouseup event listeners in parallel)
- Dynamic code (e.g. implementing slide feature that would allow resizing of grid up to 64x64)
